# Goin' Out Of My Head
## An Example of Lilypond functionality

This is my preferred way to write sheet music, historically.

I like quickly banging out a leadsheet like this, but I wish
Lilypond had some other important functionality.

I dream about writing my own version of lilypond someday,
but it's not a high priority of mine. I hope somebody does
it.

Here are some things that would be great:

### Cleaner, more reliable formatting

You can see in this document that a custom function had to
be made to increase spacing between the header and the sheet
music. This is such a foundational function that it should
not need to be custom made.

Relatedly, maybe my workflow needs refinement, but I do not
find it easy to create reliably formatted leadsheets without
a lot of tweaking. Like I said, it could be me, but I feel
like the main purpose of Lilypond is not reflected in the
amount of tweaking that I usually feel that I need to do.

What are they called "sane defaults"? ;)

### Detaching melody from rhythm

I wish that a rhythm could be assigned to a melody, and vice
versa. This could make transcription so much easier
considering how often melodies are repeated with slight
rhythmic variation.

Relatedly, considering how often rhythms are repeated with
harmonic or chordal variation... well obviously this would
be a really useful function.

### Easily creating variations

Maybe I should just be concatenating variables more. I guess
that's a reasonable solution.
